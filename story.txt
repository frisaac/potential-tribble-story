Faith was a girl at UW-Madison. She really wanted to pass her CS 400 class so she made a txt 
story as per Debra's instructions!

Then Professor Deb made us do the dreaded RBT assignment. After spending countless hours ( > 20) and many late nights working on it, the due date finally came. However, due to the unexpectedly hard 
algorithm we were to implement for an RBT insert, many peoole struggled to finish it properly. 

Gradescope ran, we cried, canvas simply laughed. All we can hope is Professor Deppeler takes mercy on our poor souls

Alas, the students could relax after putting blood sweat and tears into the project. However,
exam season was still in full swing; students can't seem to catch a breath.
The only good thing about all of these exams is that spring break is closely approaching.

But the coming of spring break also means the next exam is closer. Having experienced the
crazyness of GradeScope and canvas deadlines, students have little extra power to fight against
exams.
