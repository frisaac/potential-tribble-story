Faith was a girl at UW-Madison. She really wanted to pass her CS 400 class so she made a txt 
story as per Debra's instructions!

Then Professor Deb made us do the dreaded RBT assignment. After spending countless hours ( > 20) and many late nights working on it, the due date finally came. However, due to the unexpectedly hard 
algorithm we were to implement for an RBT insert, many peoole struggled to finish it properly. 

Gradescope ran, we cried, canvas simply laughed. All we can hope is Professor Deppeler takes mercy on our poor souls
